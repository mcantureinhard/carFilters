## How to run

Create virtualenv for each repo.
for each repo run pip install -r requirements.txt
Run each with python main.py

## The idea
The idea with this service is to have pipelines where data flows.
Due to time constraints I'll do a crude implementation of this.
Pipelines are composed of stages
Data will flow through the stages of a pipeline and as a result will modify this data.
I.E remove/add elements, add/remove to each element and so
